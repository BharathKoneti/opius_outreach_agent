## Pre-Fundraising Preparation

### Foundation Requirements
**Before you even think about fundraising:**

1. **Explosive Growth Trajectory** (John Li - Vimcal)
   - Last 3 months of growth matter more than everything else
   - VCs invest in momentum, not just potential
   - Show clear acceleration in key metrics

2. **Clear Path to $10B** (John Li - Vimcal)
   - Articulate how you reach $10B+ market opportunity
   - VCs won't invest if they think you can only reach $100M
   - Show massive scalability potential

3. **Team Validation** (Gregory Raiz - FoundersEdge)
   - **Team. Team. Team.** - Most critical factor
   - Showcase track record and complementary strengths
   - Demonstrate why THIS team can execute

4. **Customer Validation** (Multiple Sources)
   - Talk to 100+ founders, survey 2000+ customers before launching
   - Understanding your customer creates alignment
   - Becomes a wedge to build better, differentiated product

## Creating FOMO & Competitive Dynamics

### The Marty Kausas Playbook (Pylon - $3.2M in 6 days)

**Timeline Strategy:**
- **Monday 9:30 AM**: First call
- **Wednesday**: Tier-1 VCs showing up to meetings
- **Thursday**: 3rd conversations and in-person meetings  
- **Saturday**: Term sheet received

**Key FOMO Tactics:**

1. **Back-Channel HARD**
   - Have customers and network recommend you to VCs
   - Avoid direct cold outreach - use warm introductions
   - Build social proof before you even pitch

2. **Strategic Scheduling**
   - Schedule less exciting investors Mon/Tue for practice
   - Save top-tier VCs for Wed/Thu when you're warmed up
   - Create artificial scarcity with tight timeline

3. **Parallel Process Management**
   - **46 meetings in 5 packed days** - create massive competition
   - Run simultaneous processes, not sequential
   - Make VCs feel they're competing against each other

4. **Timing Advantage**
   - Started right after SVB collapse - created urgency
   - Use market conditions to your advantage
   - Create external pressure for quick decisions

### Advanced FOMO Techniques (Axel Bard Bringéus)

1. **Timing Control**
   - "Don't let anyone into the process until YOU decide when to start"
   - Control the narrative and timeline

2. **Simultaneous Launch**
   - "Make sure to launch with multiple VCs at the same time"
   - Create competitive environment from day one

3. **Social Proof Cascade**
   - Get early commitments to create momentum
   - Use each "yes" to get the next "yes"

## Pitch Deck Strategy

### Core Principles (Jeremy Horn - REACH Venture Partners)

1. **Lead with the Team**
   - Games/products rise and fall on execution
   - Execution comes down to people
   - Showcase track record and strengths first

2. **Show, Don't Tell**
   - Avoid walls of text and complex explanations
   - Create visual, game-like mockup slides
   - Use polished concept art, sketches, even AI (but highlight creative skills)

3. **Keep it Tight and Light**
   - **10-15 slides maximum**
   - Include 3-5 full-page product mockups
   - Clear financial ask and support structure
   - Specify equity vs. non-dilutive capital needs

4. **Pitch One Thing**
   - Singular focus - don't pitch 3 different opportunities
   - Tell us what you believe in most
   - If you're not all-in on one concept, hard to ask others to be

### VC Fund Pitch Deck Structure (Artem Pochepetskyi)
*Applicable principles for startup decks:*

1. **Investment Thesis** - Your unique approach/vision
2. **Market Opportunity** - Size and timing
3. **Competitive Advantage** - Your unfair advantage
4. **Team & Track Record** - Why you'll win
5. **Financial Projections** - Path to returns
6. **Use of Funds** - Specific allocation
7. **Exit Strategy** - How investors get returns

## Investor Targeting & Outreach

### Qualification Criteria (Chris Folayan)

**RED FLAGS - Don't waste time with investors who:**
- Have no track record in your sector
- Are known for difficult terms or founder-unfriendly behavior
- Don't have sufficient fund size for your round
- Are at end of fund lifecycle
- Have reputation for slow decision-making

### Sector-Specific Approach (Anshuman Sinha)

**Critical Insight:** *"Most pitch advice is garbage because it ignores this brutal truth:"*

- **Fundraising in SaaS ≠ fundraising in AI**
- **Building credibility in Fintech ≠ Consumer**
- **"Traction" means something completely different across sectors**

**Your sector dictates:**
- What traction VCs expect
- How strong your moat needs to be  
- What metrics matter in early stages
- Whether storytelling or defensibility will close the round

### Research & Preparation
1. **Portfolio Analysis** - Study their investments
2. **Investment Thesis** - Understand their focus areas
3. **Recent Activity** - Check their latest posts/announcements
4. **Mutual Connections** - Leverage warm introductions
5. **Fund Lifecycle** - Ensure they're actively investing

### Pre-Meeting Preparation
1. **Know Your Numbers Cold**
   - Every metric, assumption, and projection
   - Be ready for deep-dive questions
   - Have backup slides for detailed discussions

   - Show how you complement their thesis
   - Demonstrate market knowledge

3. **Prepare for Objections**

   - Practice with advisors/mentors

### During the Meeting
1. **Control the Narrative**

## Negotiation & Term Sheet Strategy

### Key Principles
1. **Raise the MINIMUM You Need** (Nihal Mehta/Sahil Bloom)
   - Keep yourself lean and mean
   - Optimize your own dilution
   - "Your team should always feel too small"
   - "Less money raised leads to more success" - Fred Wilson

2. **Multiple Term Sheets**
   - Never negotiate with just one offer
   - Create competitive tension
   - Use offers to improve terms

3. **Focus on Key Terms**
   - Valuation (pre/post money)
   - Liquidation preferences
   - Board composition
   - Anti-dilution provisions
   - Drag-along/tag-along rights

### Negotiation Tactics
1. **Leverage Competition**
   - "We have multiple interested parties"
   - Set decision deadlines
   - Use FOMO to your advantage

2. **Know Your Walk-Away Point**
   - Define minimum acceptable terms
   - Be prepared to say no
   - Have backup options ready
