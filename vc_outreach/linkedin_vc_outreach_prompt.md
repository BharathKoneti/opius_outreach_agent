# LinkedIn VC Outreach Campaign Prompt Template

## Campaign Overview
**Objective**: Contact venture capital professionals (VCs) on LinkedIn to introduce Opius AI and build connections for potential investment opportunities.

**Target**: General Partners, Managing Partners, and Founders at VC firms
**Platform**: LinkedIn (using connection invitations with personalized notes)
**Strategy**: Avoid InMail to save credits, focus on 2nd degree connections for better response rates

## Campaign Instructions

### Step 1: Search Strategy
Use LinkedIn search with these terms:
- "venture capital general partner"
- "managing partner venture capital"
- "VC general partner"
- "venture capital founder"

### Step 2: Target Selection Criteria
**Prioritize in this order:**
1. **2nd degree connections** (highest priority - better response rates)
2. **1st degree connections** (if available)
3. **3rd+ degree connections** (only if no better options)

**Look for:**
- "Connect" button (indicates ability to send invitation) - may be under "More" button
- Relevant titles: General Partner, Managing Partner, Founder, Principal
- Active VC firms (check recent activity/posts)

### Step 2.5: Profile Vetting Process
**MANDATORY**: Click on each potential target's profile to thoroughly vet them before sending connection requests.

**Profile Vetting Checklist:**
1. **Click on the VC's name/profile** to open their full LinkedIn profile
2. **Verify Current Role**: 
   - Is their title accurate and current?
   - Are they actually at a VC firm (not just claiming to be)?
   - Check "Experience" section for role duration
3. **Investment Focus Assessment**:
   - Read their "About" section for investment thesis
   - Check if they invest in tech/software companies
   - Look for AI, developer tools, or relevant sector experience
4. **Firm Validation**:
   - Click on their company name to verify it's a real VC firm
   - Check firm size and investment stage (seed, series A, etc.)
   - Look for portfolio companies in their posts/activity
5. **Activity Level**:
   - Check recent posts (last 3 months)
   - Look for investment announcements or industry commentary
   - Verify they're actively posting about VC/startup topics
6. **Geographic Relevance**:
   - Check their location (SF Bay Area, NYC, etc.)
   - Ensure they invest in US companies if we're US-based
7. **Connection Quality**:
   - Review mutual connections (if 2nd degree)
   - Check if mutual connections are relevant to our industry

**Disqualification Criteria:**
- Not currently active in VC role
- Focus on non-tech sectors (healthcare, energy, etc.)
- Only invests in very early pre-seed or very late stage
- Located in regions where they don't invest in US companies
- Inactive LinkedIn profile (no posts in 6+ months)
- Suspicious or incomplete profile information

**Documentation During Vetting**:
- Take note of their investment focus for potential customization
- Note any relevant portfolio companies
- Flag any mutual connections for potential warm introductions

### Step 3: Connection Process
**IMPORTANT**: Only proceed after completing Step 2.5 Profile Vetting

1. Navigate back to search results after profile review
2. Look for "Connect" button for qualified targets:
   - **Direct Connect**: Click "Connect" button if visible
   - **Hidden Connect**: If only "Message" and "More" buttons are visible, click "More" → then "Connect"
   - **Follow Only**: If only "Follow" button is available, skip this target (cannot send connection request)
3. Select "Add a note" 
4. Use the personalized message template below
5. Send invitation
6. Confirm "Pending" status appears

### Step 4: Message Template
**Character limit**: 300 characters (aim for 263-268 characters)

```
Hi [NAME], at Opius AI we're building autonomous AI agents for software development without PMs/engineers. Planning Agent in early access, launching soon. https://opiusai.com/ https://open-vsx.org/extension/opius-ai/opius-planner-cursor Would love to stay connected!
```

**Template Variables:**
- `[NAME]`: Replace with the VC's first name
- Keep URLs exactly as shown (they're proven to work)
- Message has generated positive responses in previous campaigns

### Step 5: Tracking & Documentation
**MANDATORY**: Create a detailed tracking log for each campaign session.

**File Format**: Create a markdown table file named `linkedin_vc_outreach_log_[DATE].md`

**Required tracking fields:**
- VC Name (First Last)
- Title
- Company
- LinkedIn Profile URL
- Connection Degree (1st, 2nd, 3rd+)
- Date Contacted (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Time Contacted (HH:MM)
- Status (Sent/Pending/Accepted/Declined/No Response)
- Message Sent (Yes/No - confirm template was used)
- Response Received (Yes/No)
- Response Notes
- Follow-up Required (Yes/No)
- Next Action

**Sample Log Entry:**
```markdown
| VC Name | Title | Company | LinkedIn URL | Connection Degree | Date | Time | Status | Message Sent | Response | Response Notes | Follow-up | Next Action |
|---------|-------|---------|--------------|-------------------|------|------|--------|--------------|----------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Daniel Myers | General Partner | Crosslink Capital | linkedin.com/in/danielmyers | 2nd | 2025-01-27 | 14:30 | Pending | Yes | No | - | Yes | Wait 1 week |
```

**Documentation Process:**
1. **Before starting**: Create the tracking file for the session
2. **During outreach**: Add each VC immediately after sending invitation
3. **After each VC**: Update status and confirm message was sent
4. **End of session**: Review and summarize results
5. **Weekly review**: Check for responses and update statuses

**File Location**: Save in `/vc_outreach/logs/` directory
