**Objective**: Contact venture capital professionals (VCs) on LinkedIn to introduce Opius AI and build connections for potential investment opportunities.

**Target**: General Partners, Managing Partners, and Founders at VC firms
**Platform**: LinkedIn (using connection invitations with personalized notes)

Use LinkedIn search with these terms:
- "venture capital general partner"
- "managing partner venture capital"

- "venture capital founder"

### Step 2: Target Selection Criteria
**Prioritize in this order:**
1. **2nd degree connections** (highest priority - better response rates)
2. **1st degree connections** (if available)
3. **3rd+ degree connections** (only if no better options)

**Look for:**
- "Connect" button (indicates ability to send invitation)
- Relevant titles: General Partner, Managing Partner, Founder, Principal
- Active VC firms (check recent activity/posts)

### Step 3: Connection Process
1. Click "Connect" button
2. Select "Add a note" 
3. Use the personalized message template below
4. Send invitation
5. Confirm "Pending" status appears

### Step 4: Message Template
**Character limit**: 300 characters (aim for 263-268 characters)
