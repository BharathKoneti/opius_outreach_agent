## 🔴 **REDDIT API INTEGRATION - COMPLETE BLUEPRINT**

### ✅ **REDDIT APP SETUP COMPLETED - JUNE 16, 2025**

#### **🔐 Reddit API Credentials**
```env

```

#### **2. Reddit Posting API - WORKING**
```javascript
// Post creation endpoint
POST /api/social/reddit/post
{
  "content": "Post title and body text",
  "subreddit": "test", 
  "flair": {
    "text": "Discussion",
    "id": ""
  }
}
→ Creates Reddit self post using stored OAuth tokens
```
