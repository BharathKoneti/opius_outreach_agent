Your agentic editors are missing one thing:

Direction.

You give it vague instructions → it builds the wrong thing.
You give it perfect instructions → it builds perfectly.

The problem? Creating those perfect instructions.

Opius Built an AI planner that does exactly this:
→ Analyzes your project idea
→ Generates step-by-step roadmap
→ Feeds structured plan directly to Composer

Result: Composer builds exactly what you envisioned.

Just launched as a Cursor extension.

### **Thread Version**
```
🧵 Why your Cursor Composer builds aren't living up to the hype:

1/ Composer is incredible at execution
But terrible at knowing WHAT to execute

2/ The real bottleneck isn't the AI's coding ability
It's the quality of instructions you give it

3/ Vague prompts = disappointing results
Perfect prompts = perfect builds

4/ So we built an AI planner that bridges this gap:
→ Takes your project idea
→ Analyzes requirements  
→ Generates structured roadmap
→ Feeds directly to Composer

5/ Now Composer builds exactly what you envisioned
Because it finally knows the full context

Your agentic editors are missing one thing:

Direction.

As developers, we give them vague instructions → they build the wrong thing.
We give them perfect instructions → they build perfectly.

The problem? Creating those perfect instructions.

This is the challenge I faced building multiple projects with Cursor Composer and Windsurf Cascade.

So we built Opius Planner - an AI that does exactly this:
→ Analyzes your project idea
→ Generates step-by-step roadmap  
→ Feeds structured plan directly to Composer

Result: Composer builds exactly what you envisioned.

The difference has been transformative for our development workflow.

Just launched as a Cursor extension for fellow developers facing the same challenge.

## 🔴 **REDDIT VERSIONS**

### **r/artificial Version**
```
Title: Built an AI planner that makes Cursor Composer actually useful

Hey r/artificial,

Been using Cursor Composer for months and kept running into the same issue - incredible execution, terrible at understanding what to build.

The Problem:
Composer is like having the world's best developer who needs perfect instructions. Give it vague prompts and you get disappointing results. Give it structured plans and it builds flawlessly.

Our Solution:
Built an AI planner that bridges this gap:
- Analyzes project requirements 
- Generates step-by-step implementation roadmap
- Outputs structured prompts optimized for Composer
- Maintains context across the entire build

Results:
- 90% reduction in back-and-forth iterations
- Projects actually match the original vision
- Composer finally lives up to the hype

Just launched as a Cursor extension for anyone dealing with similar frustrations.

Technical details and demo: https://open-vsx.org/extension/opius-ai/opius-planner-cursor

Open to questions about the implementation!

### **r/programming Version**
```
Title: Open sourcing our approach to structured AI code generation

Hey r/programming,

Spent months fighting with agentic editors like Cursor Composer. The issue isn't their coding ability - it's the instruction quality.

Built a solution that generates structured implementation plans:

```python
# Example output structure
{
  "project_overview": "...",
  "technical_requirements": [...],
  "implementation_phases": [
    {
      "phase": "Setup & Architecture",
      "tasks": [...],
      "composer_prompts": [...]
    }
  ],
  "testing_strategy": "..."
}
```

This structured approach increased our success rate with AI coding from ~30% to ~90%.

Key insights:
- AI needs context, not just tasks
- Implementation order matters significantly  
- Structured prompts > conversational prompts
- Planning phase is crucial for complex projects

Released as Cursor extension: [link]
Planning to open source the core algorithm - thoughts on the approach?

### **r/startups Version**
```
Title: How we solved the "AI coding tool disappointment" problem

Hey r/startups,

Anyone else feel like Cursor Composer and similar tools are simultaneously amazing and frustrating?

The Issue:
These tools can code brilliantly when they understand the goal. But most of us give them vague instructions and wonder why the output doesn't match our vision.

What We Built:
An AI planner that sits between your idea and the coding AI:
1. You describe your project vision
2. AI analyzes and creates structured implementation plan
3. Plan gets fed to Composer with perfect context
4. Composer builds exactly what you envisioned

Results After 3 Months:
- 10x faster prototyping
- Actually ship features that work
- No more "that's not what I meant" moments

For other founders struggling with AI development tools - this approach changes everything.

Just launched as a Cursor extension. Happy to share our learnings!

## 📰 **HACKER NEWS VERSION**

### **Show HN Post**
```
Title: Show HN: AI planner that gives Cursor Composer the structure it needs

We've been using Cursor Composer for months and kept hitting the same wall - incredible execution when it understands the goal, but most prompts are too vague.

Built an AI planner that bridges this gap. You describe your project vision, it generates a structured implementation roadmap with context-rich prompts optimized for Composer.

Technical approach:
- Requirements analysis using fine-tuned language models
- Dependency mapping for complex projects  
- Phase-based implementation planning
- Prompt optimization for agentic editors

The difference is dramatic - went from ~30% satisfactory results to ~90% with Composer.

Live demo: https://open-vsx.org/extension/opius-ai/opius-planner-cursor

Planning to open source the core algorithm. Would love feedback from the HN community!
```

### **Technical Deep-Dive Version**
```
Title: Structured prompt generation for agentic AI coding tools

After analyzing 200+ failed Cursor Composer sessions, we identified the core issue: instruction quality, not AI capability.

Built a system that transforms vague project ideas into structured implementation plans:

Key Components:
1. Requirements Parser - extracts technical specs from natural language
2. Dependency Mapper - identifies implementation order constraints
3. Context Generator - maintains state across multi-step builds
4. Prompt Optimizer - formats instructions for maximum AI comprehension

Implementation uses:
- Fine-tuned transformer for requirement analysis
- Graph algorithms for dependency resolution
- Template engine for prompt standardization

Results: 3x improvement in first-attempt success rate with Composer.

Extension: https://open-vsx.org/extension/opius-ai/opius-planner-cursor

Interested in feedback on the approach!
