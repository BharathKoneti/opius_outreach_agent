## Campaign Instructions

### Step 1: Search Strategy
Use LinkedIn search with these terms targeting decision makers:

**For CTOs/Engineering Leaders:**
- "CTO startup"
- "VP Engineering"
- "Head of Engineering"
- "Chief Technology Officer"

**For Founders:**
- "Founder CEO technology"
- "Technical co-founder"
- "CEO startup software"

**For Product Leaders:**
- "VP Product"
- "Head of Product"
- "Product Director"

**Company Size Filters:**
- 11-50 employees (startups needing cost-effective solutions)
- 51-200 employees (SMBs with scaling challenges)
- 201-500 employees (mid-market with development bottlenecks)

### Step 2: Target Selection Criteria
**Prioritize in this order:**
1. **2nd degree connections** (highest priority - better response rates)
2. **1st degree connections** (if available)
3. **3rd+ degree connections** (only if no better options)

**MANDATORY CUSTOMER FIT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Decision-maker**: CTO, VP Engineering, or similar with authority over technology purchases
- **Company type**: Technology/SaaS/software/digital product company (not solo consultancy or large enterprise)
- **Team evidence**: Explicit or strong evidence of a sizable engineering/product team (multiple engineers, not just the founder)
- **Clear, public evidence of external funding**: Company must have verifiable evidence of VC/angel investment, accelerator/incubator participation, or a funding round (profile, company page, or news). If in stealth/early-stage, there must be a direct mention of investor backing or accelerator/incubator. If no such evidence, SKIP outreach.
- **Development Needs**: Evidence of active software development (engineering team, product releases)
- **Decision Making Role**: Title indicates they make or influence technology purchasing decisions
- **Company Growth Stage**: Series A to Series B, or established companies with scaling challenges
- **Funding/Revenue Evidence**: Clear signs of funding or revenue (avoid pre-revenue startups without funding)

**Look for:**
- "Connect" button (indicates ability to send invitation) - may be under "More" button
- Relevant titles: CTO, VP Engineering, Founder, CEO, Head of Product
- Active companies (check recent activity/posts about product development)
- **Technology Focus Indicators**: Posts about software development, engineering challenges, product launches

**IMMEDIATE DISQUALIFICATION CRITERIA:**
- **Unfunded Early Startups**: Pre-revenue companies without funding (can't afford $500-2000/month pricing)
- **Pre-Seed/Bootstrapped Only**: Companies that appear to have no external funding or revenue
- **Non-Tech Companies**: Traditional retail, restaurants, consulting, finance (unless fintech)
- **No Development Team**: Individual consultants, freelancers without teams
- **Enterprise Only**: Large corporations (1000+ employees) likely to have complex procurement
- **Wrong Decision Level**: Junior developers, interns, non-decision makers
- **Non-Software Focus**: Hardware only, manufacturing, traditional services
- **Geographic Constraints**: Companies outside target market regions

### Step 2.5: Check Tracking Files (MANDATORY)
**BEFORE ANALYZING ANY CUSTOMER CANDIDATE**: Check these files to avoid duplicate work:

1. **Check Disqualified Customers**: Open `customer_outreach/linkedin_disqualified_customers.md`
   - Search for the candidate's name
   - If found: Skip this candidate and move to next
   - If not found: Proceed to profile vetting

2. **Check Sent Requests**: Open `customer_outreach/linkedin_sent_customer_requests.md`
   - Search for the candidate's name in the quick reference list
   - If found: Skip this candidate (already contacted)
   - If not found: Proceed to profile vetting

### Step 2.6: Profile Vetting Process
**MANDATORY**: Click on each potential target's profile to thoroughly vet them before sending connection requests.

**Profile Vetting Checklist:**
1. **Click on the prospect's name/profile** to open their full LinkedIn profile
2. **Verify Current Role**: 
   - Is their title accurate and current?
   - Do they have decision-making authority for technology purchases?
   - Check "Experience" section for role duration
3. **COMPANY VALIDATION** (CRITICAL):
   - **Active Development**: Evidence of software development team or product development
   - **Company Size**: 10-500 employees (sweet spot for our solution)
   - **Technology Focus**: SaaS, software, mobile apps, web platforms, AI/ML companies
   - **Growth Stage**: Series A to Series B, or established companies with scaling needs
   - **Funding/Revenue Validation**: Evidence of funding rounds, revenue, or paying customers (avoid unfunded startups)
   - **Recent Activity**: Company posts about product updates, engineering hiring, tech challenges
4. **DECISION MAKER VALIDATION**:
   - **Authority Level**: CTO, VP Engineering, Founder, CEO, Head of Product
   - **Technology Role**: Directly involved in development decisions and budget
   - **Team Size**: Manages or influences engineering team decisions
   - **Recent Posts**: Posts about engineering challenges, hiring developers, tech stack decisions
5. **PAIN POINT INDICATORS** (IDEAL):
   - Posts about hiring challenges, development bottlenecks, or scaling issues
   - Company job postings for multiple developers
   - Mentions of development costs, time-to-market challenges
   - Technical debt or legacy system modernization needs
6. **Activity Level**:
   - Check recent posts (last 3 months)
   - Look for technology-related content, product updates, team growth
   - Verify they're actively posting about company/industry topics
7. **Geographic Relevance**:
   - Check their location (US/Canada for initial focus)
   - Ensure company operates in markets we can serve
8. **Connection Quality**:
   - Review mutual connections (if 2nd degree)
   - Check if mutual connections are relevant to our industry

**Disqualification Criteria:**
- **PRIMARY**: No evidence of funding or revenue (unfunded early startups can't afford $500-2000/month)
- **SECONDARY**: No evidence of active software development or tech team
- **TERTIARY**: Company too large (1000+ employees) or too small (<5 employees)  
- Not currently in decision-making role for technology
- Focus on non-software industries (traditional retail, manufacturing, etc.)
- Individual consultants or freelancers without teams
- Geographic mismatch with our target markets
- Inactive LinkedIn profile (no posts in 6+ months)
- Suspicious or incomplete profile information

**Documentation During Vetting**:
- Note their company's development challenges for message personalization
- Flag any relevant technologies they use
- Note mutual connections for potential warm introductions

**Update Tracking Files After Vetting**:
- **If DISQUALIFIED**: Add entry to `linkedin_disqualified_customers.md` immediately
- **If QUALIFIED**: Proceed to connection process, then update `linkedin_sent_customer_requests.md`

### Step 3: Connection Process
**IMPORTANT**: Only proceed after completing Step 2.6 Profile Vetting and confirming candidate is not in tracking files

1. Navigate back to search results after profile review
2. Look for "Connect" button for qualified targets:
   - **Direct Connect**: Click "Connect" button if visible
   - **Hidden Connect**: If only "Message" and "More" buttons are visible, click "More" â†’ then "Connect"
   - **Follow Only**: If only "Follow" button is available, skip this target (cannot send connection request)
3. Select "Add a note" 
4. Use the personalized message template below
5. Send invitation
6. Confirm "Pending" status appears
7. **IMMEDIATELY UPDATE**: Add entry to `linkedin_sent_customer_requests.md` with all details
8. **UPDATE TODAY'S LOG**: Add entry to daily session tracking
