# LinkedIn Founder Outreach Campaign Prompt Template

## Campaign Overview
**Objective**: Contact startup founders and tech company leaders on LinkedIn to introduce Opius AI and build connections for potential partnerships, early adoption, and strategic relationships.

**Target**: Founders, Co-Founders, CEOs, and CTOs at tech startups and software companies
**Platform**: LinkedIn (using connection invitations with personalized notes)
**Strategy**: Avoid InMail to save credits, focus on 2nd degree connections for better response rates

## Campaign Instructions

### Step 1: Search Strategy
Use LinkedIn search with these terms:
- "founder startup"
- "co-founder tech"
- "CEO startup"
- "CTO software"
- "founder AI"
- "founder developer tools"
- "startup founder software"

### Step 2: Target Selection Criteria
**Prioritize in this order:**
1. **2nd degree connections** (highest priority - better response rates)
2. **1st degree connections** (if available)
3. **3rd+ degree connections** (only if no better options)

**Look for:**
- "Connect" button (indicates ability to send invitation) - may be under "More" button
- Relevant titles: Founder, Co-Founder, CEO, CTO, Chief Technology Officer
- Active tech companies (check recent activity/posts)
- Software/AI/developer tools focus

### Step 2.5: Profile Vetting Process
**MANDATORY**: Click on each potential target's profile to thoroughly vet them before sending connection requests.

**Profile Vetting Checklist:**
1. **Click on the founder's name/profile** to open their full LinkedIn profile
2. **Verify Current Role**: 
   - Is their title accurate and current?
   - Are they actually founding/leading a tech company?
   - Check "Experience" section for company details and role duration
3. **Company Assessment**:
   - Read their "About" section for company description
   - Check if they're building software/tech products
   - Look for AI, developer tools, or relevant tech focus
   - Verify company stage (early startup, growth stage, etc.)
4. **Company Validation**:
   - Click on their company name to verify it's a real tech company
   - Check company size and funding stage
   - Look for product descriptions or customer testimonials
5. **Activity Level**:
   - Check recent posts (last 3 months)
   - Look for product updates, hiring posts, or industry commentary
   - Verify they're actively posting about startup/tech topics
6. **Geographic Relevance**:
   - Check their location (SF Bay Area, NYC, Austin, etc.)
   - Ensure they're building products for global/US markets
7. **Connection Quality**:
   - Review mutual connections (if 2nd degree)
   - Check if mutual connections are relevant to our industry
8. **Potential Fit Assessment**:
   - Do they build software products that could benefit from AI agents?
   - Are they in a stage where they might need development acceleration?
   - Do they have engineering teams that could use our tools?

**Disqualification Criteria:**
- Not currently active in founding/leadership role
- Focus on non-tech sectors (retail, hospitality, etc.)
- Very early stage (pre-product) or very mature companies
- Hardware-only companies with no software component
- Inactive LinkedIn profile (no posts in 6+ months)
- Suspicious or incomplete profile information
- Companies that are clearly not a fit for developer tools

**Documentation During Vetting**:
- Take note of their company's tech stack for potential customization
- Note any relevant product features or challenges mentioned
- Flag any mutual connections for potential warm introductions
- Identify specific pain points they might have mentioned

### Step 3: Connection Process
**IMPORTANT**: Only proceed after completing Step 2.5 Profile Vetting

1. Navigate back to search results after profile review
2. Look for "Connect" button for qualified targets:
   - **Direct Connect**: Click "Connect" button if visible
   - **Hidden Connect**: If only "Message" and "More" buttons are visible, click "More" → then "Connect"
   - **Follow Only**: If only "Follow" button is available, skip this target (cannot send connection request)
3. Select "Add a note" 
4. Use the personalized message template below
5. Send invitation
6. Confirm "Pending" status appears

### Step 4: Message Template
**Character limit**: 300 characters (aim for 260-270 characters)

```
Hi [NAME], at Opius AI we're building autonomous AI agents for software development. Our Planning Agent helps teams ship faster without extra PMs/engineers. Early access available: https://opiusai.com/ Would love to connect!
```

**Alternative Template for Developer Tool Founders:**
```

```

**Template Variables:**
- `[NAME]`: Replace with the founder's first name
- `[COMPANY]`: Replace with their company name (for alternative template)
- Keep URLs exactly as shown
- Choose template based on their company focus

### Step 5: Tracking & Documentation
**MANDATORY**: Create a detailed tracking log for each campaign session.

**File Format**: Create a markdown table file named `linkedin_founder_outreach_log_[DATE].md`

**Required tracking fields:**
- Founder Name (First Last)
- Title

- Company Stage (Seed/Series A/B/etc.)
- LinkedIn Profile URL
- Connection Degree (1st, 2nd, 3rd+)
- Date Contacted (YYYY-MM-DD)

- Status (Sent/Pending/Accepted/Declined/No Response)
- Message Template Used (Standard/Alternative)
- Response Received (Yes/No)
- Response Notes
- Potential Fit (High/Medium/Low)
- Follow-up Required (Yes/No)
- Next Action

**Sample Log Entry:**
```markdown
| Founder Name | Title | Company | Stage | LinkedIn URL | Connection Degree | Date | Time | Status | Template | Response | Response Notes | Fit | Follow-up | Next Action |
|--------------|-------|---------|-------|--------------|-------------------|------|------|--------|----------|----------|----------------|-----|-----------|-------------|

```

**Documentation Process:**
1. **Before starting**: Create the tracking file for the session
2. **During outreach**: Add each founder immediately after sending invitation
3. **After each founder**: Update status and confirm message was sent
4. **End of session**: Review and summarize results
5. **Weekly review**: Check for responses and update statuses

**File Location**: Save in `/founder_outreach/logs/` directory

## Campaign Execution Tips

### Best Practices
- **Quality over quantity**: Focus on relevant, high-potential targets
- **Systematic approach**: Work through search results methodically

### What to Avoid

### Success Metrics
- **Response rate**: Track acceptance vs. total invitations
