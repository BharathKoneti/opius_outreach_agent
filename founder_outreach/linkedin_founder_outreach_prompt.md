# LinkedIn Founder Outreach Campaign Prompt Template

## Campaign Overview
**Objective**: Contact startup founders and tech company leaders on LinkedIn to introduce Opius AI and build connections for potential partnerships, early adoption, and strategic relationships.

**Target**: Founders, Co-Founders, CEOs, and CTOs at tech startups and software companies
**Platform**: LinkedIn (using connection invitations with personalized notes)
**Strategy**: Avoid InMail to save credits, focus on 2nd degree connections for better response rates

## Browser Automation Setup
**IMPORTANT**: This campaign uses Playwright MCP for browser automation. The AI agent will:

1. **Navigate LinkedIn automatically** using browser automation tools
2. **Take screenshots** to analyze search results and profiles
3. **Click elements** to open profiles and send connection requests
4. **Type messages** automatically using the provided templates
5. **Track progress** through multiple pages of search results

**Browser Automation Workflow**:
- Agent will open LinkedIn and navigate to search
- Systematically analyze each candidate profile
- Check tracking files before each analysis
- Send connection requests with personalized notes
- Update tracking files immediately after each action

## Daily Session Tracking
**MANDATORY**: Maintain a daily log for each session to track progress and ensure accountability.

### Today's Session Log Format
Create and maintain a daily session summary:

## Campaign Instructions

### Step 1: Search Strategy
Use LinkedIn search with these terms:
- "founder startup"
- "co-founder tech"
- "CEO startup"
- "CTO software"
- "founder AI"
- "founder developer tools"
- "startup founder software"

### Step 2: Target Selection Criteria
**Prioritize in this order:**
1. **2nd degree connections** (highest priority - better response rates)
2. **1st degree connections** (if available)
3. **3rd+ degree connections** (only if no better options)

**Look for:**
- "Connect" button (indicates ability to send invitation) - may be under "More" button
- Relevant titles: Founder, Co-Founder, CEO, CTO, Chief Technology Officer
- Active tech companies (check recent activity/posts)
- Software/AI/developer tools focus

### Step 2.5: Check Tracking Files (MANDATORY)
**BEFORE ANALYZING ANY CANDIDATE**: Check these files to avoid duplicate work:

1. **Check Disqualified Candidates**: Open `founder_outreach/linkedin_disqualified_candidates.md`
   - Search for the candidate's name
   - If found: Skip this candidate and move to next
   - If not found: Proceed to profile vetting

2. **Check Sent Requests**: Open `founder_outreach/linkedin_sent_requests.md`
   - Search for the candidate's name in the quick reference list
   - If found: Skip this candidate (already contacted)
   - If not found: Proceed to profile vetting

### Step 2.6: Profile Vetting Process
**MANDATORY**: Click on each potential target's profile to thoroughly vet them before sending connection requests.

**Profile Vetting Checklist:**
1. **Click on the founder's name/profile** to open their full LinkedIn profile
2. **Verify Current Role**: 
   - Is their title accurate and current?
   - Are they actually founding/leading a tech company?
   - Check "Experience" section for company details and role duration
3. **Company Assessment**:
   - Read their "About" section for company description
   - Check if they're building software/tech products
   - Look for AI, developer tools, or relevant tech focus
   - Verify company stage (early startup, growth stage, etc.)
4. **Company Validation**:
   - Click on their company name to verify it's a real tech company
   - Check company size and funding stage
   - Look for product descriptions or customer testimonials
5. **FUNDING VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)**:
   - **Target Only**: Companies with verified external funding (Seed, Series A, or later)
   - **Funding Verification Requirements**: Must have verifiable external funding from recognized sources:
     - Check for investor names in LinkedIn posts/about section
     - Look for funding announcements in their activity feed
     - Search for company name + "funding" or "seed round" in recent posts
     - Verify investor names are real VCs/angels with established portfolios
     - Look for third-party validation (TechCrunch, Crunchbase, press releases, etc.)
     - Cross-reference with external funding databases (Crunchbase, PitchBook, etc.)
   - **DISQUALIFY**: Bootstrapped companies, companies claiming funding without verification, or pre-revenue/pre-product startups
6. **Activity Level**:
   - Check recent posts (last 3 months)
   - Look for product updates, hiring posts, or industry commentary
   - Verify they're actively posting about startup/tech topics
7. **Geographic Relevance**:
   - Check their location (SF Bay Area, NYC, Austin, etc.)
   - Ensure they're building products for global/US markets
8. **Connection Quality**:
   - Review mutual connections (if 2nd degree)
   - Check if mutual connections are relevant to our industry
9. **Potential Fit Assessment**:
   - Do they build software products that could benefit from AI agents?
   - Are they in a stage where they might need development acceleration?
   - Do they have engineering teams that could use our tools?

**Disqualification Criteria:**
- Not currently active in founding/leadership role
- Focus on non-tech sectors (retail, hospitality, etc.)
- **Bootstrapped companies** (no external funding validation)
- **Unverified funding claims** (no external validation of investors/funding)
- **Pre-revenue/pre-product startups** (too early stage)
- **Series B+ companies** (likely have established processes, harder to sell to)
- **"Stealth mode" without funding verification** (could be just ideas)
- Hardware-only companies with no software component
- Inactive LinkedIn profile (no posts in 6+ months)
- Suspicious or incomplete profile information
- Companies that are clearly not a fit for developer tools

**Funding Verification Methods:**
1. **LinkedIn Activity**: Recent posts about funding rounds, investor meetings, or funding milestones
2. **About Section**: Mentions of specific investors, funding amounts, or funding rounds
3. **Company Page**: Check company LinkedIn page for funding announcements
4. **Investor Validation**: If investors mentioned, verify they're real VCs/angels with established portfolios
5. **Third-Party Sources**: Cross-reference with Crunchbase, PitchBook, TechCrunch, or other funding databases
6. **External Validation**: Look for press releases, news articles, or official funding announcements
7. **Investor Portfolio Check**: Verify mentioned investors have the company listed in their portfolio

**Documentation During Vetting**:
- Take note of their company's tech stack for potential customization
- Note any relevant product features or challenges mentioned
- Flag any mutual connections for potential warm introductions
- Identify specific pain points they might have mentioned

**Update Tracking Files After Vetting**:
- **If DISQUALIFIED**: Add entry to `linkedin_disqualified_candidates.md` immediately
- **If QUALIFIED**: Proceed to connection process, then update `linkedin_sent_requests.md`

### Step 3: Connection Process
**IMPORTANT**: Only proceed after completing Step 2.6 Profile Vetting and confirming candidate is not in tracking files

1. Navigate back to search results after profile review
2. Look for "Connect" button for qualified targets:
   - **Direct Connect**: Click "Connect" button if visible
   - **Hidden Connect**: If only "Message" and "More" buttons are visible, click "More" â†’ then "Connect"
   - **Follow Only**: If only "Follow" button is available, skip this target (cannot send connection request)
3. Select "Add a note" 
4. Use the personalized message template below
5. Send invitation
6. Confirm "Pending" status appears
7. **IMMEDIATELY UPDATE**: Add entry to `linkedin_sent_requests.md` with all details
8. **UPDATE TODAY'S LOG**: Add entry to daily session tracking

### Step 4: Message Template
**Character limit**: 300 characters (aim for 260-270 characters)

## Campaign Execution Tips

### Best Practices
- **Check tracking files first**: Always check disqualified and sent request files before analyzing
- **Maintain daily log**: Update today's session log after each contact
- **Quality over quantity**: Focus on relevant, high-potential targets
- **Funding verification first**: Always verify external funding status before sending connection requests
- **Systematic approach**: Work through search results methodically
- **Personalized messaging**: Use company name when possible
- **Track everything**: Update tracking files immediately during the process
- **Focus on fit**: Prioritize founders who could actually use our product
- **Funded company priority**: Funded founders have proven traction and investor validation
- **Avoid duplicates**: Never analyze or contact the same person twice

### What to Avoid
- Don't use InMail (saves credits)
- Don't send generic connection requests without notes
- Don't target 3rd+ connections if 2nd degree options available
- Don't contact founders of companies that clearly won't benefit from AI agents
- Don't modify the proven message templates significantly

### Success Metrics
- **Response rate**: Track acceptance vs. total invitations
