## Key Differences from VC Outreach

### Target Focus
- **VCs**: Investment and funding relationships
- **Founders**: Product adoption and partnerships

### Message Templates
- More product-focused messaging
- Emphasis on development acceleration benefits
- Alternative templates for different company types

### Success Metrics
- Higher expected response rates (15-25% vs 10-15% for VCs)
- Focus on demo requests and product trials
- Conversion to paying customers

### Vetting Criteria
- Company stage and product fit assessment
- Technical team size and development needs
- Potential for AI agent adoption

## How to Use

1. **Read the main prompt**: Start with `linkedin_founder_outreach_prompt.md`
2. **Copy the log template**: Use `logs/linkedin_founder_outreach_log_template.md` for each session
3. **Follow the systematic process**: Search → Vet → Connect → Document
4. **Track everything**: Maintain detailed logs for follow-up and analysis

## Campaign Types

### High-Priority Targets
- **Developer Tools Companies**: Already understand developer productivity
- **SaaS Startups**: Have development teams that could benefit
- **AI/ML Companies**: Understand AI value proposition
- **Early-Stage Startups**: Need to move fast with limited resources

### Message Templates
- **Standard Template**: General software development focus
- **Alternative Template**: Personalized with company name and specific relevance

## Success Tracking

Each campaign should track:
- Connection acceptance rates
- Response rates to follow-up messages

- Trial sign-ups
- Conversion to paying customers

## Best Practices

1. **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on founders who could actually use our product
2. **Personalization**: Use company names and specific relevance when possible
3. **Systematic Approach**: Work through search results methodically
4. **Detailed Documentation**: Track everything for follow-up and analysis
5. **Follow-up Strategy**: Have a clear plan for nurturing connections
